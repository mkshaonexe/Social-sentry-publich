## 2. Information We Do NOT Collect

Social Sentry is designed with privacy as a core principle. We want to be clear:

✅ **We do NOT collect any personal information**  
✅ **We do NOT transmit any data from your device**  
✅ **We do NOT track your activity**  
✅ **We do NOT sell or share any data**  
✅ **We do NOT use analytics or tracking services**

## 3. How the App Works

Social Sentry uses **Android Accessibility Service** to help you stay focused by detecting and blocking access to short-form video content (Reels, Shorts, etc.) on the following apps:

- Instagram (com.instagram.android)
- YouTube (com.google.android.youtube)
- TikTok (com.zhiliaoapp.musically)
- Facebook (com.facebook.katana)
- Facebook Lite (com.facebook.lite)

**What the Accessibility Service Does**:
- Monitors screen content ONLY in the apps listed above
- Detects when you navigate to Reels/Shorts sections
- Automatically performs a "back" action to redirect you away
- All processing happens locally on your device

**What the Accessibility Service Does NOT Do**:
- Does NOT monitor any other apps
- Does NOT read your messages, passwords, or personal data
- Does NOT capture screenshots
- Does NOT record your activity
- Does NOT send any information over the internet

---

## 4. Data Storage

The app stores only the following information **locally on your device**:

- **User Preferences**: Your blocking settings (which apps you choose to block)
- **Master Toggle State**: Whether blocking is currently enabled or disabled

This data:
- Remains on your device only
- Is NOT transmitted anywhere
- Can be deleted by uninstalling the app
- Is NOT backed up to external servers

## 5. Permissions Explained

### Accessibility Service Permission

**Why we need it**: This is the core permission that allows Social Sentry to detect when you're viewing Reels/Shorts and automatically navigate away from them.

**What it accesses**: Screen content in the supported apps (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, Facebook Lite)

**What it does NOT access**: 
- Other apps on your device
- Your personal files, photos, or documents
- Your passwords or login credentials
- Your contacts or messages

**How it's limited**: The accessibility service is configured to ONLY monitor the five apps listed above. It cannot access any other apps on your device.

## 6. Third-Party Services

Social Sentry does NOT integrate with any third-party services, including:
- No advertising networks
- No analytics services (like Google Analytics)
- No crash reporting tools
- No social media integrations
- No cloud storage services

The app operates completely offline and independently.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Social Sentry does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 (or applicable age in your jurisdiction). Since we don't collect any data at all, the app is safe for all ages. However, the app is designed for users who want to manage their social media usage, which typically applies to teenagers and adults.

---

## 8. Security

Even though we don't collect data, we take security seriously:

- All settings are stored locally using Android's encrypted DataStore
- No network connections are made by the app
- The app only requests the minimum permissions necessary
- The Accessibility Service is restricted to specific apps only

---

## 9. Your Rights and Control

You have complete control over Social Sentry:

✅ **Enable/Disable**: Turn blocking on or off anytime  
✅ **Choose Apps**: Select which apps to monitor  
✅ **Revoke Access**: Disable the Accessibility Service in your device settings at any time  
✅ **Uninstall**: Remove the app completely to delete all local data

## 11. How We Use the Accessibility Service

To comply with Google Play policies, we want to be transparent:

**Primary Use**: Detecting when you navigate to Reels/Shorts sections and automatically performing a "back" navigation action to help you stay focused.

**Technical Details**:
- The service monitors accessibility events (screen changes) in the supported apps
- It searches for specific UI elements that indicate Reels/Shorts content
- When detected, it triggers a back navigation action
- All processing happens in real-time on your device
- Nothing is recorded or stored

**User Benefit**: Helps users maintain focus and reduce time spent on distracting short-form video content.

- The "Last Updated" date at the top will change
- Significant changes will be communicated through app update notes
- Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance

We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
